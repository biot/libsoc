# Documentation

This set of documentation provides explained examples of how to use libsoc. It is more extensive than the comments found in the header files and is geared towards walking users through functionality step by step. This documentation is all held in the main libsoc git repo so additions and corrections are welcomed in for the form of pull requests. If you are not using the latest version of libsoc I would recommend browsing to the your version tag and looking at documentation that was commited at the time of your versions release, as the API is still fluctuating and things may have changed.
